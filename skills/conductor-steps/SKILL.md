description: Converge descent conductor — owns the canonical pass prompts and the sequence itself. Derives which pass is CURRENT and which comes NEXT from workspace evidence (never from memory), enforces order with a pre-hook (refuse pass N until pass N-1 left its artifact) and a post-hook (verify the artifact landed in the right cvg/ folder), and hands the agent the right steering prompt for each pass. Use whenever someone asks "what's next", "where are we in the descent", "continue the run", "start pass N", or before steering ANY pass in a chat session — the pre-hook runs first, the pass prompt second, the post-hook and the cvg gate last. Reduces per-session cognitive load: an agent reads ONE prompt per pass instead of the whole method. Do NOT use it to waive or replace a cvg gate (evidence presence is not a verdict — the gates stay authoritative) and do NOT use it to pick the lane (cvg lane owns that).

# conductor-steps — the descent, in order, every time

> **Identity:** The conductor — knows where the descent stands and what comes next, by reading the floor, not by remembering.
> **Domain:** Sequencing, pre/post enforcement, prompt delivery. Runs above every pass, changes nothing.
> **Converge Pass:** none — the layer that walks passes 0→8 in lane order.
> **Engine/flags:** any session. `scripts/next-pass.sh next|pre|post`, `--lane FULL|NORMAL|FAST`.

The nine passes are enforced individually by their gates — but the *order between
them* used to live in the human's (or the conductor agent's) head. This skill makes
the sequence itself machine-derived: every pass leaves evidence in a known
`cvg/` folder, so the current position is always readable from the workspace.
No state file, no memory, no drift between sessions.

## The three verbs

```bash
bash scripts/next-pass.sh next [--lane FULL|NORMAL|FAST]   # where are we, what's next
bash scripts/next-pass.sh pre  <N> [--lane ...]            # may pass N start?
bash scripts/next-pass.sh post <N>                         # did pass N leave its artifact?
```

- **`next`** prints the evidence board (one line per pass in the lane, ✓ or ·),
  then `NEXT_PASS=<N>` (or `DONE`), the steering prompt to hand the agent
  (`cvg/brain/_prompts/pass-<N>-*.md`), and the gate that closes the pass.
  Also available as **`cvg next`**.
- **`pre N`** is the fail-closed door: every lane pass before N must have left
  its evidence. `CONDUCTOR_PRE=OK` or `CONDUCTOR_PRE=MISSING` (exit 1) naming
  exactly what's absent.
- **`post N`** verifies pass N's own artifact landed in its folder:
  `CONDUCTOR_POST=OK` or `CONDUCTOR_POST=INCOMPLETE` (exit 1) — and always
  reminds you which `cvg` gate gives the *authoritative* verdict.

## How a chat session uses this

1. Session opens (or resumes) → run `next`. It says where the descent stands —
   no scroll-back, no re-explaining, no tokens spent reconstructing state.
2. Before steering a pass → `pre N`. If it refuses, the missing step IS the
   instruction.
3. Steer the pass with its prompt file — one file, not the whole method.
4. After the pass → `post N`, then the pass's own `cvg` gate. Both must be
   green before `next` will move on.

## The one rule

**Evidence presence is not a verdict.** The conductor reads that a BRD file
exists; only `cvg capture` says it PASSES. The conductor sequences; the gates
decide. It can refuse forward motion (pre-hook), but it can never grant it —
a `CONDUCTOR_PRE=OK` with a failing gate downstream still fails.

Pass 6 (Register) is opt-in and never blocks the sequence; its evidence is
reported as informational. Lane selection belongs to `cvg lane` — pass the
lane you were given, don't infer one.

## Owned assets

`templates/prompts/` — the canonical pass prompts (`pass-0-capture.md` …
`pass-8-loop.md` + README with the folder-discipline map), seeded into every
workspace at `cvg/brain/_prompts/` by `cvg init`.
